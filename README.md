### **Project: Sales and Supply Chain Analytics using SQL**

**Tools & Technologies:** MySQL, SQL Procedures, Views, Functions  
**Key Areas:** Finance Analytics, Supply Chain Analytics, Forecasting Accuracy, Customer Sales Analysis, Top-Performing Products  

#### **Project Overview:**
- Conducted in-depth analysis of sales and supply chain performance using SQL to derive actionable insights for finance and supply chain optimization.
- Developed and implemented SQL-based solutions to calculate gross price, pre-invoice, and post-invoice discounts, leading to accurate net sales calculations.
- Created reusable SQL views (`post_inv_discount`, `net_sales`) to streamline financial performance analysis and decision-making processes.

#### **Key Contributions:**
- **Finance Analytics:**
  - Designed and executed SQL queries to analyze gross price, discounts, and net sales, enabling better financial decision-making.
  - Developed a stored procedure (`get_fiscal_year`) to calculate fiscal years based on calendar dates, improving data accuracy.
  - Created a procedure (`get_badge`) to assign sales performance badges based on total quantity sold, enhancing sales team motivation.
  - Generated reports on top 5 customers and markets by net sales, providing insights into high-performing segments.

- **Supply Chain Analytics:**
  - Integrated actual sales and forecast data to assess forecast accuracy, identifying areas for improvement in demand planning.
  - Developed a forecast error analysis system to calculate net error, absolute error, and forecast accuracy metrics.
  - Created a comparative report to analyze forecast accuracy between 2020 and 2021, highlighting customers with declining accuracy.

#### **Achievements:**
- Improved financial reporting efficiency by automating complex discount calculations through SQL views and procedures.
- Enhanced supply chain forecasting accuracy by identifying key areas of improvement, leading to better inventory management.
- Delivered actionable insights that contributed to a [specific outcome, e.g., "10% increase in sales efficiency" or "15% reduction in forecast errors"].

#### **Skills Demonstrated:**
- Advanced SQL querying, including the use of stored procedures, views, and functions.
- Data integration and analysis for finance and supply chain optimization.
- Forecasting and error analysis to improve business decision-making.
- Reporting and visualization of key performance metrics for stakeholders.
